# 📚 Library Management System (MERN Stack)

A web-based library management system designed to manage books, users, and daily library operations efficiently. [cite_start]This system helps librarians organize book records, issue and return books, and generate useful reports[cite: 4, 5].

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). [cite_start]It replaces manual library methods with a centralized digital database to track inventory and loans[cite: 30].

### Key Features (Modules)
The system is divided into 5 distinct modules, each with full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities:

1.  **👥 Member / Student Management:** Register, view, update, and deactivate student profiles.
2.  **📦 Supplier & Donation Management:** Manage book suppliers and donation records.
3.  **📚 Book Inventory Management:** Cataloging system to add, search, and manage book stock.
4.  **🔄 Circulation Management:** Handle book issuing (loans) and returns (transactions).
5.  **📢 Announcement Management:** Post and manage library news and notices on the dashboard.
